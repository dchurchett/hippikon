<title>Hippikon Authorization API</title>
</head>
<body>
Hippikon is a powerful authorization API and SDK for enforcing
complex user authorization rules for java applications. The authorization
engine is driven by an XML configuration file (static rules) and a runtime
callback mechanism (dynamic object rules) that provides permission inheritance,
permission overrides, object hierachy rules and object instance state/behaviour.<p>

Developers using the API should divert their attential to the <code>com.hippikon.security</code>
package, specifically the {@link PermissionSet}, {@link ProtectedResource} and 
{@link PermissionsFactory} classes, which form the basis of the API.<p>

The API is designed to be minimal, as easy to use as possible but with hooks that allow
a power user to go deeper. A convenient UI tool is provided to read the XML configuration
files in a more user friendly way; it has been used for quality assurance testers to better
understand the security model.<p>
