Hippikon is a powerful authorization API that was developed for enterprise software applications and is now provided free under 
Version 2.1 of the GNU LGPL.<p>

Hippikon provides features not found in existing APIs, such as Sun's JAAS. It is an XML driven mechanism that 
allows static permission rules to be defined, and also allows object state, object hierachy, user associations, 
permission inheritance and permission overrides into account at runtime. The API is small, fast and simple to use. 
The design follows a logical domain model based on a number of standard security design patterns.
