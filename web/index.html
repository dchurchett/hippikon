<div class="main">
Hippikon is a powerful authorization API that was developed for enterprise software applications and is now 
provided free under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a>. In other words, what was once 
proprietary software developed for a highly complex enterprise application where security was paramount is now a 
free open source project!</p>

Hippikon provides features not found in existing APIs, such as Sun's JAAS. It is an XML driven mechanism that allows static 
permission rules to be defined, and also allows object state, object hierachy, user associations, permission 
inheritance and permission overrides into account at runtime. The API is small, fast and simple to use. The design
 follows a logical domain model based on a number of standard security design patterns.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2><p>

<ul>
<li>May be used in any Java application and is agnostic of frameworks such as J2EE, Spring, Struts etc,
<li>XML configuration file defines static permissions and valid object hierachy
<li>A simple plugin/callback mechanism is provided to configure permissions for object instance at runtime
<li>A single instance may configure multiple products or applications
<li>Decoupled from authentication mechanisms allowing any to be used (such as basic password, LDAP, Digital Certificates etc,)
<li>Easy API to learn and use
</ul>

For more information about Hippikon, why it was created, how it was created and what
it can be used for, read through the <a href="overview.htm">overview</a> section.

<h2>What Does Hippikon Do?</h2>

The Hippikon security model makes a clear separation of concerns between the two primary
aspects of an overall security mechanism for a software system:

<ul>
<li><b>Authentication</b>: Is the user who they say they are? 
<li><b>Authorization</b>: What can an authenticated user do in a system?
</ul>

Hippikon's focus is in providing a convenient object oriented API for handling <b>authorization</b> 
that encapsulates a set of permissions for a user accessing various objects in a system. The granularity of 
Hippikon is purely based on objects, and not static pieces of code or object methods.  A typical scenario 
for securing a java application involves first authenticating a user then determing authorization rules within 
the system i.e., what can they do within the system, what data can they read?, what actions can they perform?<p>

If your application uses a simple role based system where one user may only have one role, then Hippikon
may not provide much benefit. However, if you find yourself writing a system where:<p>

<ul>
<li>a user can have multiple roles or, 
<li>a user can have multiple associations with an object (e.g., the creator, the maintainer, the owner), or 
<li>there is a need to take the object's internal state into account (e.g., if immutable turn off read access), or
<li>the object hierachy must be taken into account (e.g., a note belongs to a document, which is immutable), or
<li>a combination of all the above
</ul>

things will get out of hand very quickly and the code ends up being littered with complex conditional checks. Here
is where Hippikon will simplify the development effort tremendously. To get started take a look through the
<a href="overview.htm">overview</a>, which provides a usage scenario,  followed by 
the <a href="documentation.htm">manual</a>, which dives deeper into the framework internals.
