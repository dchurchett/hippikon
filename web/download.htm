Hippikon is provided for download as a compiled binary and source package. The API documentation
is available <a href="docs/index.html">here</a> and provided with both bundles. Only production ready releases 
will be made available here.<p>

<h2>Hippikon 4.0</h2>

Hippikon 4.0 brings the framework up to JDK 1.6 compatibility, taking advantage of generics and annotations. The major change
is making ProtectedResource an Annotation rather than a class that has to be extended. We trade off some type-safety for 
ease of use; any java object can not be a protected resource simply by using the annotation.

<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-4.0.tar.gz?download">hippikon-4.0.tar.gz</a> - for unix
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-4.0.zip?download">hippikon-4.0.zip</a> - other platforms
</ul>

<h2>Hippikon 3.3</h2>

Hippikon 3.3 provides major new functionality in the PermsNavigator GUI tool, having added the ability
to create and edit XML Policy Store files as well as simply viewing them. No core framwork changes were
made in order to change the GUI tool but extensive work was done on the tool itself, which is all
written in Swing.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.3.tar.gz?download">hippikon-3.3.tar.gz</a> - for unix
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.3.zip?download">hippikon-3.3.zip</a> - other platforms
</ul>

To run the PermsNavigator and take a tour of the new features, downlad the latest release, cd into
the directory where you extracted hippikon and type:<p>

<pre>
ant run-gui
</pre>

At this time no startup scripts have been included in the distribution.


<h2>Hippikon 3.2</h2>
An emergency patch release to fix bug #1234624 - 
the ant build script that caused hippikon.jar to be unpopulated with class files. 

<ul>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.2.tar.gz?download">hippikon-3.2.tar.gz</a> - for unix
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.2.zip?download">hippikon-3.2.zip</a> - other platforms
</ul>

<h2>Hippikon 3.1</h2>
Adds support for JDK1.5 while retaining compatibility with JDK 1.4. JDK 1.2.2 is dropped as a platform
due to changes in the reflection APIs, which is a tad frustrating.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.1.tar.gz?download">hippikon-3.1.tar.gz</a> - for unix
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.1.zip?download">hippikon-3.1.zip</a> - other platforms
</ul>

This release contained 3 lines of source code in hidden classes and is therefore identical in all ways
to Hippikon 3.0, including the download bundle directory structure. See below for details.

<h2>Hippikon 3.0</h2>
The first version ported from the original code base that has 
been in production for over 3 years. Hippikon was Written for JDK 1.2.2 and has been tested on JDK 1.4. Hippikon
3.0 does not work or compile with JDK 1.5 and will not be moved forward with future versions i.e., JDK 1.2.2 will
no longer be supported.

<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hippikon/hippikon-3.0.zip?download">hippikon-3.0.zip</a> - other platforms
</ul>


Both achive files extract to the following directory structure:<p>

<pre>
hippikon-3.0
  |
  + javadoc               (generated javadocs)
  + lib                   (compiled hippikon.jar plus dependencies)
  + license.txt           (the LGPL License in full)
  + README.txt            (general notes)
  + build.xml             (the main build file for the system)
  + Hippikon_Manual.pdf   (a PDF copy of the online developer manual)
  + src                   (the source code)
    |
    + java-src            (contains the hippikon source code)
    + test-src            (contains the hippikon test code)
       |
       + config           (test XML policy store and resource.policies)
</pre>

To install, extract to the file system, copy lib/*.jar to your application classpath resolving any
possible conflicts with other versions of junit, log4j or ant.<p>

To launch the Swing GUI permissions viewer, ensure hippikon.jar and log4j.jar are in
your classpath or pass to the JVM as the -classpath argument:

<pre>
java com.hippikon.security.PermsNavigator
</pre>

You will then be able to navigate to one of the example policy store XML files stored
under <code>src/test-src/config</code>.<p>

<h2>Hippikon 3.0 Change Log</h2>

Very few changes were made, those being to repackage and remove 
some proprietary references. Other changes include:<p>

<ul>
<li>The logging system was updated to use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a> and
a log4j.conf is provided to get the component working out-of-the-box
<li>The unit tests now use the latest version of JUnit to avoid all the pesky javac warnings 
due to the <code>assert</code> keyword having been introduced in the JDK 1.4
<li>XML Parsing is delegated to the APIs bundled in the JDK
<li>the Ant build script is updated to create the tar and zip bundles and to launch
the Swing GUI for viewing XML policy store files
<li>Added the LGPL license header to all files
<li>Added <code>getDefinedPrinicipals()</code> to the <code>PolicyStore</code> interface to
support the PermsNavigator
</ul>

<h2>External Dependencies</h2>

The following APIs are bundled with Hippikon in the lib directory:
<ul>
<li>Junit 3.8.1
<li>log4j-1.2.9
</ul>

To build and run Hippikon you will need to have installed JDK 1.4 or 1.5 (as of Hippikon 3.1 or greater) 
and have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set to the installation directory. You will also need to 
have installed ANT 1.6.2 or greater (the build file was written for ANT 1.6.2) and have the ANT_HOME 
environment variable set to the ANT installation directory. You will also need to have $ANT_HOME/bin in your path. Ant 
should pickup the right version of java from the JAVA_HOME variable but if you have another version of 
Java in your path you may have problems so check here first.<p>

You will need to have junit.jar (located in the lib directory of the hippikon release) 
in your $ANT_HOME/lib directory in order to use the build script from the command 
line. If you are using an IDE see the IDE documentation for setting up sources and classpaths in order to get
the build script working.<p>

See the <code>README.txt</code> file bundled with the download package for general release details.<p>

<h2>Obtaining The Source</h2>

Anyone may obtain the source code by downloading one of the official releases, or from 
the CVS repository. Instructions on using CVS for Hippikon can be found on 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=139356">the sourceforge CVS project page</a>.<p>

To obtain the java source files, checkout the module named 'authorization' off the TRUNK for the
latest code (may not be stable) or a known tag, which can be found by browing the CVS repository
using sourceforge's browser tool (located on the same CVS project page).<p><p>
